### Here's a folder for the gloVe vectors that can be downloaded from this [github repository](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe).

This solution uses the `Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5` set.

Nevertheless, you don't have to do it in order to test run the program. Please, don't rerun cells in `read_glove_vectors.pynb` file!
